# Dump

Dump is like a group chat with yourself.  
Use it however you like. Dump anything.


A unique ID and link will be generated for each dump.  
Copy the link to see or add dumps in the future.  
Share the link with others to use the same dump.


The project is currently hosted at [dump-web-app.netlify.app](https://dump-web-app.netlify.app)

This is a hobby project for learning [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
